For decades, Flat Earth believers have pointed to Antarctica as the outer boundary of our world — an immense ice wall that surrounds the Earth's disk.

But why is the continent so heavily guarded? Why do major governments agree on one thing: **you can't explore Antarctica freely**?

Could it be that what's beyond the wall defies everything we've been taught?
